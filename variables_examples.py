# What is a variable?
# A variable is a container to store data
# It is called a variable because it is a symbolic name that is a reference/pointer to an object
#eg: x = 5, x is the variable name pointing to the int object 5
import time

a = 30
b = 10.5
z = "Ilhaan"
a = 15

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(z))
print(a)
print(id(a))

# == is an equality operator for booleans meaning it returns true or false.
#it does this by checking if the two operands are equal

#Explain: What's the difference between a dynamically typed language (like Python) and a strong typed language ?
# Type-checking (determining data types) happens during run-time for python vs before the program runs
#Dynamicallt typed languages allow for more flexibility
#you can add an int to a float in python without error
# the id of the variable changes because the unique identifier for the specified object is based on the value
