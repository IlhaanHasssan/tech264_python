import json
# What does it stand for?
# JAVASCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION
#
# What is it used for?
# STORING AND EXCHANGING DATA BETWEEN SYSTEMS
#
# What is it written in?
# IT WAS DEVELOPED FOR JAVASCRIPT BUT IT IS A LANGUAGE-INDEPENDENT DATA FORMAT
#
# Include a simple example of JSON
# JSON =
# {
#   "name": "Alice",
#   "age": 30,
#   "city": "Wonderland",
#   "is_student": true
# }
#
# Advantages of using it?
# Compact and Efficient Format:
# JSON’s concise syntax allows for easy parsing of data.
# Its lightweight nature makes it efficient for transmitting data over networks.
# APIs, web services, and microservices often use JSON due to its efficiency.
# Human-Readable:
# JSON is both human-readable and machine-readable.
# Its simple text-based structure makes it easy for developers to read and write.
# Unlike more verbose formats (such as XML), JSON is straightforward to interpret.
# Widely Supported:
# JSON is supported by virtually all major programming languages.
# Whether you’re using JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, or others, JSON is a common choice.
# This widespread support makes it an ideal format for exchanging data between systems.
# Data Preservation:
# JSON can represent complex data structures, including nested objects and arrays.
# When transmitted, object hierarchies and relationships are preserved.
# The receiving end can reassemble the data appropriately for its programming environment.
# Web Applications Prefer JSON Over XML:
# JSON has largely replaced XML for web applications.
# It’s faster to parse and easier to work with.
# APIs and RESTful services commonly use JSON for data exchange.
#
# 
#
# What data types can it store/use?
#  It can use strings, arrays, booleans, numbers, objects and null data type
#
# What is the JSON syntax for:
# Name value pairs?
# Name-Value Pair Syntax:
# In JSON, a name-value pair consists of a field name (or key) followed by a colon (:) and then a value.
# The field name (key) must be enclosed in double quotes (").
# The value can be a string, number, boolean, object, array, or null.
#
# Objects?
# A JSON object is enclosed in curly braces {}
#
# How to separate data (key/value pairs) from one another?
# with a colon between the key and the value, then a comma between the key-value pairs
#
# JSON arrays (these are like lists in python)?
# eg:
# {
#   "fruits": ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
# }
