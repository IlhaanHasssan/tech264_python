# Battle game
#Make a 2 player battle game using Python.
#Player selects a character/fighter (from 4-6) or gets one assigned to them randomly.
#If Player 2, let them pick the character/fighter they want. If CPU, assign a character/fighter randomly.
#The two Pokemon/fighters/characters need to fight.
#A winner must be declared via some sort of calculation.
#Bonus: Want to play again?
#Note: No Pygame or Turtle allowed. CLI only.
