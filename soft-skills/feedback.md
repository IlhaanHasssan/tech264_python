### ***TMAY Feedback:***
  - Dial back talking about the past and include more about future aspirations for your career
  - Include hobbies and interests
  - Emphasise your transferable and technical skills
  - Include more about your motivations

### ***DevOps "Your Role" Presentation Feedback***
  - My delivery, tone and pitch were  conversational and relaxed, could be improved with peaks and troughs for emphasis.
  - My use of animation/imagery could be misleading with arrows pointing towards the wrong thing so be conscious of using appropriate SMARTART.
  - Talking for a minute straight could be improved by breaking it up with relevant images to reference.
  - Improve energy levels when presenting.
  - Should have been more specific when answering my question, for example, a devops engineer does scrum/agile meetings but more specifically will have meetings about version control etc.
  - Include a good title slide for an appropriate introduction.

### ***Mock Interview:***
- less filler words
- TMAY: too much about why I chose DevOps
- restarted TMAY due to nervousness
- good balance of academic and personal interests
- sounded knowledgeable
= not very clear when talking about who assigns tasks when implementing scrum framework, could be clearer about when assigning of tasks takes place.
- Well spoken â€“ knowledgeable

### ***Merge Conflict Feedback:***
  - Positives:
    - Page of Contents is good
    - Well explained with animation from Adonis
    - Audience interaction/input can be beneficial?
    - Mixing it up is good
    - visual walkthroughs are good, but could've made them link more



  - Negatives:
    - bad time-keeping
    - convoluted explanation, could have been more concise
    - use of merge conflict resolution via GitHub, CLI, IDE could be very confusing as watchers didn't know where to look
    - Talking about merge pull request was a new thing to explain and could've been confusing to some
    - Should've avoided detail about git rebase
    - Other ' best practices' should've been prioritised such as clear communication
    - basically i talk too much
    - process of approval instead of explaining the entire process of merge pull request
    - KISS - keep it super simple 
    - having to pick up toddlers to scale a large staircase when you could walk them up a staircase with smaller steps
    - make sure you make use of your visual aids better
