### Different phases of DevOps methodologies:
- Development
- Testing
- Integration
- Deployment
- Monitoring
- Feedback
- Operations


### What will you not be doing in 2-5 years?
- Start as a Junior DevOps Eng for 2 years
- 2-5 years you will be Mid-Level DevOps Eng or just a DevOps Eng
-After, 5-10 years you will be the Lead DevOps Eng

### How could DevOps be integrated into a project?
- Integrate a monitoring and feedback loop from your team and the software. Have alerts set up so you know how things are running. 
- Implementing Version Control to manage code changes effectively, which is essential for Continous Integration
- Set up automated CI/CD pipelines using DevOps tools
- Ensure collaboration in teams and forster open communication


### Why might DevOps use Python?
- Extensive libraries and frameworks to help with DevOps-related tasks
- Simple, readable syntax
- Strong community support and resources
- Applicable to a wide range of tasks and applications
- Automates tasks efficiently with Python scripts

### Why might we need to use APIs as DevOps?
- Automate interactions with cloud services (e.g., Azure, AWS)
- Retrieve and manipulate data from specific services or systems
- Manage and interact with DevOps tools

### Why is Linux so popular for DevOps engineers?

1. **Open-source and customizable**:
   - Linux is free and open-source, allowing DevOps engineers to tailor their environments as needed.

2. **Strong command-line interface (CLI)**:
   - DevOps workflows often involve scripting and automation, and Linux's powerful CLI, along with bash/shell scripting, makes it ideal for automation.

3. **Automation and scripting**:
   - Linux supports a wide range of automation tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef, which are crucial for infrastructure management.

4. **Security and control**:
   - Linux provides fine-grained control over system security and permissions, which is important for managing environments securely.

5. **Wide tool support**:
   - Many DevOps tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins) run natively on Linux, making it the default choice for infrastructure deployment.

6. **Stability and reliability**:
   - Linux is known for its stability, which is critical when running servers and cloud environments.

7. **Cloud and container dominance**:
   - Major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and container technologies (Docker, Kubernetes) are built on or optimized for Linux, making it a natural fit for DevOps.

8. **Community support**:
   - Linux has a strong, active community, offering plenty of resources, forums, and documentation to help solve problems.
